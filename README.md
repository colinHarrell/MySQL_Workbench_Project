My database project was built off the soccer team Real Madrid based in Spain. They are in the league called La Liga. I used the transfer market website as well as soccerpunter.com and espn.com for all my data. The data I obtained from these sources were the overall team stats throughout the 2023/24 season and the individual player stats. Some stats I loaded in were date and time of games and the score. I also did the venue of where each match was played. For individual player stats I loaded in goals, assists, yellow cards and more. I found the name of Real Madridâ€™s coaches online, too. I did not have any major problems throughout the project, as it went smoothly and consistently. This was all my original work and was done individually. One thing that was challenging to figure out was how to properly format and insert the date/time values without error.
